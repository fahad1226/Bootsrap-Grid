				<p><strong>Education</strong> is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed
					research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators and also learners may also educate themselves.[1] Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on
					the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
					Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
					A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[2] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.

						<p><strong>During the High Middle Ages,</strong> Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western
							Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers,including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford.
